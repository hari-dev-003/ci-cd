# CI/CD Project

This project is a foundational Node.js web application built with Express.js. It is designed to be containerized using Docker, enabling consistent deployment and execution across various environments. This setup is suitable for a simple web service or as a base for more complex applications.

## Project Overview

The application leverages Node.js as its runtime environment and utilizes Express.js, a minimalist web framework, to handle web requests. The primary entry point for the application is the `index.js` file, which initializes the Express server.

## Technologies Used

*   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
*   **Express.js**: Minimalist web framework for Node.js.
*   **Docker**: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

## Installation

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd ci-cd
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository. This is a placeholder as the URL was not provided.)*

2.  **Build the Docker image**:
    This command builds the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`. Ensure you are in the root directory of the project.
    ```bash
    docker build -t ci-cd .
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Docker container**:
    This command runs the built Docker image and maps port 3000 on your host machine to port 3000 inside the container.
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 ci-cd
    ```
2.  **Access the application**:
    Once the container is running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

### Running Tests

The project includes a basic test script. You can run it using:
```bash
npm test
```
This command will execute the `test` script defined in `package.json`, which currently outputs "Test Completed".
